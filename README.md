# cTSS
This simple set of scripts and UI is a dirty draft for converting [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/) to the [Titanium Alloy TSS](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Alloy_Styles_and_Themes) format. It's far from perfect but it's a nice starting point.

Having something like this in place would allow you to copy-paste styling from a HTML/CSS UI-builder or [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)'s CSS export into your Titanium Alloy project.

Please do fork ;)

## Dependecies
This script relies on:

* [JSCSSP](http://www.glazman.org/JSCSSP/)
* [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org)
* [Slick.Parser](https://github.com/mootools/slick)

## Resources
Scripts I considered and learned from:

* [Sheet.js](https://github.com/subtleGradient/Sheet.js)
* [CSSOM](https://github.com/NV/CSSOM)

## Roadmap
* Provide more decent UI and verbose logging
* Support and validate more properties (background image..)
* Support and validate more units and values (url, gradient..)
* Real-time parsing while typing CSS
